# NLP Comment Filtering
Artificial Intelligence Course 4th Project: Implementing Bigram and Unigram models for filtering comments.
<br>
In this group project we ([pouyanhessabi](https://github.com/pouyanhessabi) and [omidmahyar](https://github.com/omidmahyar)) implemented `Bigram` and `Unigram models` to filter comments.<br>

We trained these models on these positive and negative datasets. We also used `smoothing` in both models (you can change coefficients). For preprocessing first we removed punctuation marks and we also have a `cut_down` parameter which specifies that words with equal or less number of repetition to this parameter should be removed. Also there is a `cut_above` parameter that specifies that how many of most repeated words 
should be removed.

Project report (in persian): [here](https://github.com/pouyanhessabi/AI-project4-NLP/blob/main/AI_P4.pdf) <br> tried different coefficients and tried the models with and without cut_down and cut_above and checked the results
